This repository accompanies the [Amazon MSK migration lab](https://amazonmsk-labs.workshop.aws/en/migration.html). 
It includes resources used in the lab including AWS CloudFormation templates, configuration files and Java code.


## Install

### Clone the repository and install the jar file.  

    mvn clean install -f pom.xml
      
Two java jar files will be created:

#### CustomMM2ReplicationPolicy

This jar file is related to the use of [Kafka MirrorMaker2](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-382%3A+MirrorMaker+2.0) in the lab to migrate a self-managed Apache Kafka cluster 
to [Amazon MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/). 

MirrorMaker v2 (MM2), which ships as part of Apache Kafka in version 2.4.0 and above, detects and 
replicates topics, topic partitions, topic configurations and topic ACLs to the destination cluster that matches a regex topic pattern. 
Further, it checks for new topics that matches the topic pattern or changes to configurations and ACLs at regular configurable intervals. 
The topic pattern can also be dynamically changed by changing the configuration of the MirrorSourceConnector. 
Therefore MM2 can be used to migrate topics and topic data to the destination cluster and keep them in sync.
                   
In order to differentiate topics between the source and destination, MM2 utilizes a **ReplicationPolicy**. 
The **DefaultReplicationPolicy** implementation uses a **\<source-cluster-alias\>.\<topic\>** naming convention as described 
in [KIP-382](https://cwiki.apachorg/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-382%3A+MirrorMaker+2.0#KIP-382:MirrorMaker2.0-RemoteTopics,Partitions).The consumer, 
when it starts up will subscribe to the replicated topic based on the topic pattern specified which should account for 
both the source topic and the replicated topic names. This behavior is designed to account for use cases which need to run multiple 
Apache Kafka clusters and keep them in sync for High Availability/Disaster Recovery and prevent circular replication of topics.

In migration scenarios, it might be useful to have the same topic names in the destination as the source as there is no 
failback requirement and the replication is only way from the self-managed Apache Kafka cluster to Amazon MSK. 
In order to enable that, the DefaultReplicationPolicy needs to be replaced with a CustomReplicationPolicy which would 
maintain the same topic name at the destination. This jar file needs to be copied into the **libs** directory of the 
Apache Kafka installation running MM2.

#### MM2GroupOffsetSync

When replicating messages in topics between clusters, the offsets in topic partitions could be different 
due to producer retries or more likely due to the fact that the retention period in the source topic could've passed 
and messages in the source topic already deleted when replication starts. Even if the the __consumer_offsets topic is replicated, 
the consumers, on failover, might not find the offsets at the destination.

MM2 provides a facility that keeps source and destination offsets in sync. The MM2 MirrorCheckpointConnector periodically 
emits checkpoints in the destination cluster, containing offsets for each consumer group in the source cluster. 
The connector periodically queries the source cluster for all committed offsets from all consumer groups, filters for 
topics being replicated, and emits a message to a topic like \<source-cluster-alias\>.checkpoints.internal in the destination cluster. 
These offsets can then be queried and retrieved by using provided classes **RemoteClusterUtils** or **MirrorClient**. However, 
in order for consumers to fail over seamlessly and start consuming from where they left off with no code changes, 
the mapped offsets at the destination need to be synced with the __consumer_offsets topic at the destination. The 
MM2GroupOffsetSync application performs this syncing periodically and checks to make sure that the consumer group is empty or dead 
before doing the sync to make sure that the offsets are not overwritten if the consumer had failed over.

The jar file accepts the following parameters:  

* **-h (or --help): help to get list of parameters**
* **-cgi (or --consumerGroupID) (Default mm2TestConsumer1)**: The Consumer Group ID of the consumer to sync offsets for.
* **-src (or --sourceCluster) (Default msksource)**: The alias of the source cluster specified in the MM2 configuration.
* **-pfp (or --propertiesFilePath) (Default /tmp/kafka/consumer.properties)**: Location of the producer properties file which contains information about the Apache Kafka bootstrap brokers and the location of the Confluent Schema Registry.
* **-mtls (or --mTLSEnable)(Default false)**: Enable TLS communication between this application and Amazon MSK Apache Kafka brokers for in-transit encryption and TLS mutual authentication. If this parameter is specified, TLS is also enabled. This reads the specified properties file for SSL_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION_CONFIG, SSL_KEYSTORE_LOCATION_CONFIG, SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_CONFIG and SSL_KEY_PASSWORD_CONFIG. Those properties need to be specified in the properties file.
* **-ssl (or --sslEnable)(Default /tmp/kafka.client.keystore.jks)**: Enable TLS communication between this application and Amazon MSK Apache Kafka brokers for in-transit encryption.
* **-rpc (or --replicationPolicyClass)(Default DefaultReplicationPolicy)**: The class name of the replication policy to use. Works with the custom replication policy mentioned above.
* **-rps (or --replicationPolicySeparator)(Default ".")**: The separator to use with the DefaultReplicationPolicy between the source cluster alias and the topic name.
* **-int (or --interval)(Default 20)**: The interval in seconds between syncs.
* **-rf (or --runFor) (Optional)**: Number of seconds to run the producer for.
     
## Usage Examples
